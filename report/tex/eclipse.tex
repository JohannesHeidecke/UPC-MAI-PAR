\section{Eclipse Instructions}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Import the project via \texttt{File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace}
	\item Navigate to class \texttt{problem.Solve}
	\item Choose the input file for the main method by either:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Changing the constant \texttt{INPUT\_PATH} to the desired path, or
		\item Going to \texttt{Run > Run Configuration > Arguments > Program arguments} and copying the relative or absolute file path in the first line.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Run the main method of \texttt{problem.Solve}.
	\item The results can be found in the directory \texttt{data/out}.
\end{enumerate}


To run the experiment that our results are based on:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Navigate to class \texttt{problem.coffee.validator.CoffeeExperiments}.
	\item Run the main method.
	\item Results can be found in the directory \texttt{data/generated}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{steps...} contains the number of steps for the different methods. The first four columns correspond to the order in the figures of our result section. The last column are the steps for the optimal solution (calculated with brute force).
		\item \texttt{test...} contains 1000 different worlds, one per line.
		\item \texttt{test\_matrix...} contains graphical representations of all 1000 worlds.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
