\section{Outlook}

The results of our experiments are promising and show, that even relatively simple heuristics can substantially reduce the number of steps  required to solve the coffee problem. One possible improvement is to use a more sophisticated heuristic to calculate the TSP\footnote{Traveling Salesman Problem}-like route between the different petitions. 

It might also potentially yield interesting results to test the algorithm on larger worlds. Some first experimental trials on worlds with a size of 10,000 fields with several thousands of petitions have shown that the two used heuristics managed to reduce the number of steps from about 4 million to about 20,000 while only requiring approximately 15\% more computation time. The optimal solution could not be computed with brute force in this case since the number of possible permutations exceeds available computation power by far.
