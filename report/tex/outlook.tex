Better algorithm than NN to get a good round trip of petitions

Test on larger fields. Some first experiments on worlds with a size of 100,000 fields with several ten-thousands of petitions have shown that the two used heuristics managed to reduce the number of steps from about 4 million to about 20,000 while only requiring approximately 15\% more computation time. The optimal solution could not be computed with brute force in this case since the sheer number of possible permutations exceeds available computation power by far.
