\section{Outlook}

The results of our experiments were promising and showed, that even relatively simple heuristics can substantially improve the number of required steps to solve the coffee problem. One possible improvement would be, to use a more sophisticated heuristic to calculate the TSP-like route of the different petitions. 

It would also potentially yield interesting results to test the algorithm on larger worlds. Some first experiments on worlds with a size of 100,000 fields with several ten-thousands of petitions have shown that the two used heuristics managed to reduce the number of steps from about 4 million to about 20,000 while only requiring approximately 15\% more computation time. The optimal solution could not be computed with brute force in this case since the sheer number of possible permutations exceeds available computation power by far.
